#Functions that calculate entropies in different ways:
#Given a frequency array, alpha value (the summation index for each S_i, in AA's it's 21), return a numpy array with the entropies S_i


#Given an entropy array, do things with it (other functions):



#Selector functions that, given a "word code", calculates a kind of entropy -- or f*** it, calculate every single one could be an option too.
