#Here will lie future code relating to the study of each AA's properties

#I would take an approach similar to colormapping (and entropy, for that matter) -- create various ways to divvy up the AA's


#Given a way to divide AA's in groups, and a frequency array of each AA (we'll ned the dictionaries for that), return another frequency array according to that segmentation
