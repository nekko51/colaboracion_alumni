# Next steps (LP - Low priority; MP - Medium Priority; HP - High Priority; UHP - Critical Priority)
- [UHP] Extract the position of frequencies that are over a certain value (e.g. 0,4) to compare the binary results; maybe go back to the idea of making subplot every 25-50 positions that was discarded?
Maybe, to compare, parallel to making the binary plot, it'd be nice to graph JUST the (aromatics, for example), to see which change.

- [VISUAL - LP] Make it so the name of the aminoacid shows up in its correspondig point on the graph if its frequency is higher than some value (e.g. 0.5)

- DISCARDED - [DATA - MP] Maybe make sub-plots (every 25-50 positions, make a new graph) to compare more easily

- [HP] Come up with more ways to compare the two plots.

- [TOYING AROUND - LP] Try poking around and tweaking the sequences so that there exists an offset between the data (don't know what that'd be good for, but I'll just throw it in the list i guess)

- [MP] Maybe rethink the functions so that we can work with the "frequency" and "appearance" arrays (e.g. to generate various plots with different colormaps efficiently, without calculating them for every plot)
